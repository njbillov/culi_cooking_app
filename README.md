# Culi

A new Flutter project.

Any files named *_example.dart or *_test.dart can be deleted.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Notes
This project is configured such that it compiles down to iOS properly.  There is still work needed to port for Android.
Some features like shake for feedback do not work in simulation.

A lot of the recipe flow and widgets are split between meal_scheduler.dart, groceries.dart, grocery_list.dart, recipe_overview.dart, menu_home.dart, and theme.dart.
